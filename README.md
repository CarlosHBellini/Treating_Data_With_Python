# Treating_Data_With_Python
  I needed to get some costumers data from a ERP and it was all messed up, so I decided to use python to clear it and learn in the process.

  All the data was in the same format as the the data in the file "Safe.txt", I took my time to censor the personal information from the clients.
In the original files there was 42k contacts, but a really big number of contacts didn't have a telephone nor a cellphone number to contact.
Most of them weren't from my city, so I had to filter them by city, and some didn't even had the name registered.
After the whole process I ended up with almost 14k contacts, and the program print them on a good format for me to load them in a excel and work with them.

  I have to say that maybe there's a better way to code each of the processes, but I took the oportunity to use it in a learning purpose in addition.
